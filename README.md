# here we go again...

**Goal: unequivocally mog yapcine's setup**

- Have something like Aider / Claude code / codex but ~~impossible to use~~
extensible
- Integrate other ideas as they're leaked by Pliny/Tibor/etc
- Ideally can overlap in features with LLM Chat (e.g. memory)
- Maintain benchmarks on included prompts and scaffolding on private code (rvm,
iqd, etc.) for reference and for maliciously farming and baiting engagement on X
- Be reasonable in the design of backends. like Aider not like Open WebUI
